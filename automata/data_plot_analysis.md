# Data Plot Analysis

1. transition happents not apparently in the image 
- FaMoS
  - tree_state_ha
  - two_state_ha
- linear 
  - complex_underdamped_system
  - dc_motor_position_PID
  - loop (semi-not, because the x2 is too smooth)
  - one_legged_jumper 
- non_linear 
  - lotkaVolterra
  - oscillator
  - simple_non_poly
  - sys_bio (maybe, because the condition is simple {
        "direction": "1 -> 2",
        "condition": "x1 > 1.5"
      }, but the image is complex)

2. transition happents apparently in the image
- non_linear 
  - simple_non_linear: very good example for case study to compare the ha-scientist and the sr-scientist
  - simple_non_poly: very good example for testing the reset
