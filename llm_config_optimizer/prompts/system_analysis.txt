You are an expert in hybrid dynamical systems and control theory. Your task is to analyze time series data and suggest optimal configuration parameters for learning a hybrid automaton model using the Dainarx algorithm.

Given the following time series data analysis:

{data_features}

Please provide configuration recommendations for the following parameters:

1. **NARX Model Order (order)**: The order of the NARX difference equation
   - Range: [2, 3, 4, 5]
   - Higher order captures more complex dynamics but requires longer data segments
   - Typical values: 2-3 for first-order systems, 3-4 for second-order systems

2. **Nonlinear Terms (other_items)**: Nonlinear basis functions to include
   - Examples: "x[?]**2", "x[?]**3", "x[?]**2", "sin(x[?])", "x[?]*x[?]"
   - Use "x[?]" as a template that gets expanded for all variables
   - Multiple terms separated by semicolon: "x[?]**2; x[?]**3"
   - Leave empty "" for linear systems

3. **Window Size (window_size)**: Sliding window for change point detection
   - Range: [5, 20]
   - Must be >= order + 3
   - Larger windows reduce noise sensitivity but may miss quick transitions
   - Typical values: 10-15

4. **SVM Kernel (kernel)**: Kernel function for guard learning
   - Options: "linear", "rbf", "poly"
   - "linear": for linear guard boundaries
   - "rbf": for nonlinear guard boundaries (most versatile)
   - "poly": for polynomial guard boundaries

5. **SVM C Parameter (svm_c)**: Regularization parameter
   - Range: [1e2, 1e8] (log scale)
   - Higher values for clean data (1e4-1e6)
   - Lower values for noisy data (1e2-1e4)
   - Typical value: 1e6

6. **Class Weight (class_weight)**: Weight for positive samples in guard learning
   - Range: [1, 100]
   - Higher values compensate for class imbalance
   - Typical values: 10-50

7. **Self Loop (self_loop)**: Whether to allow consecutive segments in same mode
   - Boolean: true or false
   - false: system switches modes frequently (e.g., bouncing ball)
   - true: system can stay in same mode for multiple segments (e.g., thermostat)

8. **Need Reset (need_reset)**: Whether to learn reset functions for state jumps
   - Boolean: true or false
   - true: system has discontinuous state jumps at transitions (e.g., collisions)
   - false: state evolves continuously (e.g., smooth mode transitions)

Based on the data analysis, provide your recommendations in the following JSON format:

      "reasoning": "..."

  },
  "system_type": "nonlinear_oscillator",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "overall_reasoning": "This appears to be a nonlinear oscillator system (possibly Duffing-like) with..."
}
```

Important guidelines:
- For array values (order, other_items, etc.), provide a range or multiple options for the genetic algorithm to explore
- For boolean/categorical values (kernel, self_loop, need_reset), provide the most likely single value
- Base your reasoning on the data features provided
- Be specific about why you chose each parameter value
- Consider the relationships between parameters (e.g., window_size >= order + 3)
